## Partner:
N/A (Assigned at end of class)

## Problem:

"Given a string, capitalize the letters that occupy even indexes and odd indexes separately, and return as shown below. Index 0 will be considered even.

For example, capitalize("abcdef") = ['AbCdEf', 'aBcDeF']. See test cases for more examples.

The input will be a lowercase string with no spaces."

## Process for Solving the Challenge:

1.  Split string in to an array
2.  Loop to capitalize desired items in to two new arrays
3.  Join individual letters back in to respective strings within the arrays
4.  Join in to final array (concat? push?)
